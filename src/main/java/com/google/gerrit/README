The plugins/qualcomm/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit directory is a place to share code among
plugins with the belief that the functionality within should someday be implemented in Gerrit core.
Because we are going to try an upstream most of the generic plugins, it might not be worth putting
much code in here, and it is worth considering duplication instead.
