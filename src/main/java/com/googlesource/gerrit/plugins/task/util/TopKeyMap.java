/**
 * A TopKeyMap is a lightweight limited size (default 5) map with 'long' keys designed to store only
 * the elements with the top five largest keys.
 *
 * <p>A TopKeyMap is array based and has O(n) insertion time. Despite not having O(1) insertion
 * times, it should likely be much faster than a hash based map for small n sizes. It also is more
 * memory efficient than a hash based map, although both are likely O(n) in space usage. The
 * TopKeyMap allocates all of its entries up front so it does not change its memory utilization at
 * all, and it does not have to create or free any Objects during its post constructor lifespan.
 *
 * <p>While a TopKeyMap currently only uses 'long's as keys, it is possible to easiy upgrade this
 * collection to use any type of Comparable key.
 *
 * <p>Although not currently thread safe, due to the simplicity of the data structures used, and the
 * insertion approach, it is easy to make a TopKeyMap efficiently thread safe.
