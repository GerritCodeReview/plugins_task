      "message": "Maybe we need to be more specific in our definition of \"skipped\". What all are we skipping when a task is expensive? From the code below, it seems we only skip subtask and in-progress evaluation.\n\nShould we also be skipping applicability? Validity? Duplicity (i.e. no point in having a task that\u0027s both skipped and duplicate, and skipped is less costly to check)? Applicability in particular might be what\u0027s expensive in a task, so it seems odd to still compute that. I\u0027m ok we decide it makes sense to keep that behavior, but we need to document it.",
