      "message": "I\u0027ll be honest, I really don\u0027t like this approach. It would be better to have a more generic filtering mechanism which is not root specific and allows you to specify any node in the tree to mark as \"not applicable\". \n\nI think the approach I propose would have the additional benefit of working if you start recursing over dependencies at some point, and a dependency points to a node outside of the root that you want to filter. With the --task--root approach, that dependency would likely get evaluated, whereas with the approach I propose it would likely halt as you would want.",
