	description = The task plugin provides a mechanism to manage tasks which\n\
need to be performed on changes along with a way to expose\n\
and query this information. Tasks are organized\n\
hierarchically, and task definitions use gerrit queries to\n\
define which changes each task applies to, and how to define\n\
the status criteria for each task. An important use case of\n\
the task plugin is to have a common place for CI systems to\n\
define which changes they will operate on, and when they will\n\
do so.
