However, we can add logic in the UI code to keep it selected when the page loads if some criteria is met.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Side note: It seems odd that both \"needed\" and \"passed\" are the same color.\n\nYeah, agree, we should differentiate them. Currently, they are the same green color in the task-tree view. So, I kept them the same in summary view, to be consistent. At some point, we should revisit the colors and icons.",
